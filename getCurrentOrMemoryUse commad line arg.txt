Host Memory Use
String[] vmemory = {"/bin/sh","-c","vmstat -s|head -2"};//linux command to get memory use
 cmdProc = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(vmemory);

or we could use

run = Runtime.getRuntime();
command = "free";//linux cmd for 
process = run.exec(command);//cmd toexecute the process for memory use
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Host Current User
 cmdProc = Runtime.getRuntime().exec("users");

or we could use:

run = Runtime.getRuntime();//to run the linux command
command = who;//linux comand to determine who the user is
process = run.exec(command);

we can use the run or cmdProc for everyone of our server requirmnets to the clinent. 
I found multiple cmds that can do the same thing.
